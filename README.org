* Llama — Compact syntax for short lambda

This package implements the macro ~##~, which provides compact
syntax for short ~lambda~, without actually being new syntax,
which would be difficult to get merged into Emacs.  Past attempts
to add syntax were met with determined pushback and the use of a
macro was suggested as an alternative.

The ~##~ macro, whose signature is ~(## FN &rest BODY)~, expands
to a ~lambda~ expression, which wraps around these arguments.

This ~lambda~ expression calls the function FN with arguments
BODY and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
symbols found in BODY.

Each symbol from ~%1~ through ~%9~, which appears in BODY,
specifies a mandatory argument.  Each symbol from ~&1~ through
~&9~, which appears in BODY, specifies an optional argument.
All arguments following an optional argument have to be optional
as well, thus their names have to begin with ~&~.  Symbol ~&*~
specifies extra (~&rest~) arguments.

The shorter symbol ~%~ can be used instead of ~%1~, but using both
in the same expression is not allowed.  Likewise ~&~ can be used
instead of ~&1~.

Instead of:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (lambda (a _ &optional c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))
#+end_src

you can use this macro and write:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)
#+end_src

which expands to:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (lambda (%1 &optional _&2 &3 &rest &*)
    (foo %1 (bar &3) &*))
#+end_src

Unused trailing arguments and mandatory unused arguments at the
border between mandatory and optional arguments are also supported:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (##list %1 _%3 &5 _&6)
#+end_src

becomes:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (lambda (%1 _%2 _%3 &optional _&4 &5 _&6)
    (list %1 &5))
#+end_src

Note how ~_%3~ and ~_&6~ are removed from the body, because their
names begin with an underscore.  Also note that ~_&4~ is optional,
unlike the explicitly specified ~_%3~.

The name ~##~ was chosen because that allows (optionally)
omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
It also looks similar to ~#'function~.
