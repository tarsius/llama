This package implements the macro `##`, which provides compact
syntax for short `lambda`, without actually being new syntax,
which would be difficult to get merged into Emacs.  Past attempts
to add syntax were met with determined pushback and the use of a
macro was suggested as an alternative.

The `##` macro, whose signature is `(## FN &rest args)`, expands
to a `lambda` expressions, which wraps around its arguments.

This `lambda` expression calls the function FN with arguments
ARGS and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
symbols found in ARGS.

Each symbol from `%1` through `%9`, which appears in ARGS,
specifies an argument.  Each symbol from `&1` through `&9`, which
appears in ARGS, specifies an optional argument.  All arguments
following an optional argument have to be optional as well, thus
their names have to begin with `&`.  Symbol `&*` specifies extra
(`&rest`) arguments.

Instead of `%1`, the shorthand `%` can be used; but that should
only be done if it is the only argument, and using both `%1` and
`%` is not allowed.  Likewise `&` can be substituted for `&1`.
Finally, for backward compatibility, `%*` can be used in place
of `&*`, but only if there are no optional arguments.

Instead of:

```elisp
(lambda (a _ &optional c &rest d)
  (foo a (bar c) d))
```

you can use this macro and write:

```elisp
(##foo %1 (bar &3) &*)
```

which expands to:

```elisp
(lambda (%1 _%2 &optional &3 &rest %*)
  (foo %1 (bar &3) %*))
```

The name `##` was choosen because that allows (optionally)
omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
It also looks similar to `#'function`.
