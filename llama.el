;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements the macro `##', which provides compact
;; syntax for short `lambda', without actually being new syntax,
;; which would be difficult to get merged into Emacs.  Past attempts
;; to add syntax were met with determined pushback and the use of a
;; macro was suggested as an alternative.

;; The `##' macro, whose signature is (## FN &rest args), expands
;; to a `lambda' expressions, which wraps around its arguments.

;; This `lambda' expression calls the function FN with arguments
;; ARGS and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
;; symbols found in ARGS.  Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which
;; appears in ARGS, is treated as a positional argument.  Missing
;; arguments are named `_%N', which keeps the byte-compiler quiet.
;; In place of `%1' the shorthand `%' can be used, but only one of
;; these two can appear in ARGS.  `%*' represents extra `&rest'
;; arguments.

;; Instead of:
;;
;;   (lambda (a _ c &rest d)
;;     (foo a (bar c) d))
;;
;; you can use this macro and write:
;;
;;   (##foo % (bar %3) %*)
;;
;; which expands to:
;;
;;   (lambda (% _%2 %3 &rest %*)
;;     (foo % (bar %3) %*))

;; The name `##' was choosen because that allows (optionally)
;; omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
;; It also looks similar to #'function.

(defmacro ## (fn &rest args)
    "Expand to a `lambda' expression that wraps around FN and ARGS.

This `lambda' expression calls the function FN with arguments
ARGS and returns its value.  Its own arguments are derived from
symbols found in ARGS.  Each symbol from `%1' through `%9', which
appears in ARGS, is treated as a positional argument.  Missing
arguments are named `_%N', which keeps the byte-compiler quiet.
In place of `%1' the shorthand `%' can be used, but only one of
these two can appear in ARGS.  `%*' represents extra `&rest'
arguments.

Instead of:

  (lambda (a _ c &rest d)
    (foo a (bar c) d))

you can use this macro and write:

  (##foo % (bar %3) %*)

which expands to:

  (lambda (% _%2 %3 &rest %*)
    (foo % (bar %3) %*))

The name `##' was choosen because that allows (optionally)
omitting the whitespace between it and the following symbol.
It also looks a bit like #\\='function."
